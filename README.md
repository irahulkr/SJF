# SJF
Write a program in C which reads input CPU bursts from a the first line of a text file named as CPU_BURST.txt. Validate the input numbers whether the numbers are positive intergers or not. Consider the numbers as CPU burst.If there are 5 positive integers in the first line of the text file then the program treat those argument as required CPU bust for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turn around time. Consider used scheduling algorithm as SJF and same arrival time for all the processes.
